At this point in time, our program can only be run via the command line. This is only temporary and will be resolved in the very near future.
Directions to run the program from terminal:
	1.cd into the 'Project' directory
	2.run the jar with the command : java -jar UMPD.jar

The jar can be run on any computer, but in order to see the functionality of the scheduler, it must be run on windows, as the scheduler,
a previously written piece of code in visual basic, is only runnable on windows machines.
